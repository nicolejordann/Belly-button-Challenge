# belly-button-challenge
This is a repository for challenge 14, or else "belly-button-challenge"


Hello! 

In this repository you will find the HTML and Javascript code for the challenge. To look into the code in detail, please find it under the  “static” folder followed by the “js” folder. 

The app is very cool, a couple of details:
- Make sure you select your test subject from the dropdown. From this selection you’ll be able to visualize the top 10 OTUs as well as a  bubble chart that displays each sample.
- You will also be able to look at a gauge chart which displays the belly button washing frequence (per week)
- Feel free to access the page via: https://fraguti14.github.io/belly-button-challenge/
